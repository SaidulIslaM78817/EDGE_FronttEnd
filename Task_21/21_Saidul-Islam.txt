Command to Create a React App:
- Command: `npm create vite` 
1. Provide Project Name: `project-name` 
2. Select Framework: `React` 
3. Select Variant: `JavaScript` 


Folder and File Explanation:

1. node_modules
   - Contains all the dependencies for the project (like React and other npm packages). 
   - This folder is automatically generated and doesn’t need manual modification. 

2. public
   - Stores static files that are publicly accessible. 

3. index.html
   - The main HTML file of the app. 
   - Includes the root `<div id="root"></div>`, where React mounts the app during initialization. 

4. src
   - Contains the source code of the React application. 
   - App.css: Defines styles for the `App.jsx` component. 
   - App.jsx: The main component serving as the app’s root component, usually defining the structure and layout. 
   - index.css: Holds global CSS styles applied across the app. 
   - main.jsx: The entry point of the app. Imports React and ReactDOM to render the root `App` component into the `index.html` file’s `<div id="root"></div>`. 

5. .gitignore
   - Specifies files and directories for Git to ignore (e.g., `node_modules/`, build files). 

6. package.json
   - Contains app configuration, dependencies, scripts, and metadata (e.g., app name, version). 
   - Essential for managing dependencies and running commands like `npm start` or `npm run build`.
